## 💻 Local Development Setup (Optional)

> **Note:** The application is already deployed and live at the URLs above. This section is only for developers who want to run the project locally for development or testing purposes.

### Quick Local Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Cloudinary account

**1. Clone & Install:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MusicWebApplication

# Backend
cd Backend && npm install

# Frontend
cd "../Music Web Application" && npm install

# Admin
cd ../admin && npm install
```

**2. Environment Variables:**

Create `.env` files in each directory:

```env
# Backend/.env
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_generated_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Music Web Application/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# admin/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd Backend && npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd "Music Web Application" && npm run dev

# Terminal 3 - Admin
cd admin && npm run dev
```

**Local URLs:**
- Backend: `http://localhost:4000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Admin: `http://localhost:5173`

---

## 🔒 Security Fixes Applied

### 1. JWT Secret Vulnerability (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Hardcoded fallback `'your-secret-key'` allowed token forgery

**Fixed Files:**
- `Backend/src/controllers/authController.js`
- `Backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

**Before (VULNERABLE):**
```javascript
jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-secret-key')
```

**After (SECURE):**
```javascript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!JWT_SECRET) {
  throw new Error('FATAL: JWT_SECRET environment variable is not set');
}
jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET)
```

### 2. Missing .gitignore (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** `.env` file could be committed to version control

**Fixed:** Created `Backend/.gitignore` with:
```
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
node_modules/
*.log
dist/
```

### 3. Unprotected Admin Routes (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Anyone could add/delete songs and albums

**Fixed Files:**
- `Backend/src/routes/songRouter.js`
- `Backend/src/routes/albumRouter.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
songRouter.post("/add", upload.fields([...]), addSong);
albumRouter.post("/remove", removeAlbum);
```

**After:**
```javascript
songRouter.post("/add", authenticateToken, upload.fields([...]), addSong);
albumRouter.post("/remove", authenticateToken, removeAlbum);
```

### 4. Open CORS Policy (HIGH)

**Issue:** Any website could make requests to your API

**Fixed:** `Backend/server.js`
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
  process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  process.env.ADMIN_URL || 'http://localhost:5173',
];

app.use(cors({
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.indexOf(origin) !== -1) {
      callback(null, true);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 5. Missing Environment Documentation

**Fixed:** Created `.env.example` files for all 3 apps with all required variables documented

### 6. Production Sourcemaps Enabled

**Issue:** Source code exposed in production builds

**Fixed:** `Music Web Application/vite.config.js`
```javascript
build: {
  sourcemap: false  // Disabled for security
}
```

## 🎯 Main Features Explained

### 1. User Authentication (JWT)

**How it works:**
1. User enters email/password
2. Backend validates credentials with bcrypt
3. Backend generates JWT token with user ID
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage
5. Token sent with every API request in Authorization header
6. Backend verifies token before accessing protected routes

**Files:**
- `Backend/src/controllers/authController.js` - Login/register logic
- `Backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js` - Token verification
- `Music Web Application/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Auth state management

### 2. Music Player

**Features:**
- Play/pause, next/previous, seek bar
- Volume control (0-100%)
- Shuffle mode, repeat mode
- Auto-advance to next song

**How it works:**
- Uses HTML5 `<audio>` element controlled via React refs
- Audio src set to Cloudinary URL
- Event listeners: `timeupdate`, `ended`, `loadedmetadata`
- State managed in PlayerContext

**Files:**
- `Music Web Application/src/context/PlayerContext.jsx` (1200+ lines)
- `Music Web Application/src/components/Player.jsx` - UI controls

### 3. Playlist Management

**Features:**
- Create, edit, delete playlists
- Add/remove songs
- User-specific (each user has their own)

**How it works:**
1. User creates playlist → POST `/api/playlist/create`
2. Backend stores with user ID from JWT
3. Only owner can modify their playlists
4. Playlists reference songs by ID

**Files:**
- `Backend/src/controllers/playlistController.js`
- `Music Web Application/src/components/CreatePlaylistModal.jsx`
- `Music Web Application/src/components/DisplayPlaylist.jsx`

### 4. Liked Songs

**Features:**
- Like/unlike any song
- Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- Persistent across sessions

**How it works:**
1. User clicks heart → UI updates immediately
2. Request sent to `/api/song/like`
3. Backend adds song ID to user.likedSongs array
4. If request fails, UI reverts

**Files:**
- `Backend/src/controllers/songController.js` - `likeSong()`, `unlikeSong()`
- `Music Web Application/src/context/PlayerContext.jsx` - `toggleLikeSong()`

### 5. Recently Played

**Features:**
- Auto-tracks last 5 songs played
- Shows relative timestamps ("5m ago", "2h ago")
- Sorted by most recent first

**How it works:**
1. When song plays → POST `/api/song/recently-played`
2. Backend adds entry with current timestamp
3. Keeps only last 5, removes duplicates
4. Frontend calculates relative time on render

### 6. Search

**Features:**
- Real-time search (updates as you type)
- Search songs, albums, playlists
- Accent-insensitive, case-insensitive

**How it works:**
- All data loaded to frontend once
- Search done client-side (fast filtering)
- Debounced 220ms to avoid excessive filtering
- Uses Unicode normalization for accents

### 7. File Upload (Admin)

**How it works:**
1. Admin selects audio file + cover image
2. Multer saves to temp folder on server
3. Files uploaded to Cloudinary via API
4. Cloudinary returns secure URLs
5. URLs saved to MongoDB
6. Temp files deleted from server

**Files:**
- `Backend/src/middleware/multer.js` - File upload config
- `Backend/src/controllers/songController.js` - Upload logic
- `admin/src/pages/AddSong.jsx` - Upload UI

### 8. Theme Switching

**Features:**
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Saves preference to localStorage
- Auto-detects system preference

**How it works:**
- On load: Check localStorage → system preference
- Toggle adds/removes `dark` class on `<html>`
- TailwindCSS `dark:` classes apply automatically
